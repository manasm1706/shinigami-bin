# Fortune Tone Guidelines

## Core Principles

When generating or writing fortune text for the Shinigami-bin platform, adhere to these strict tone and style guidelines:

### 1. Mysterious and Cryptic Phrasing

- Use ambiguous, open-ended statements that hint at deeper meanings
- Employ metaphorical language involving death, spirits, shadows, and the supernatural
- Reference liminal spaces, boundaries between worlds, and the unknown
- Avoid direct, literal predictions
- Create an atmosphere of ancient wisdom and otherworldly knowledge

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Your shadow moves independently when no one watches"
- ✅ "The boundary between realms grows thin around you"
- ❌ "You will have a good day today"
- ❌ "Success is coming your way"

### 2. Subtle Humor and Sarcasm

- Inject dry, dark humor that fits the death-themed aesthetic
- Use ironic observations about mortality and fate
- Include playful jabs at the futility of fortune-telling itself
- Keep humor understated—never obvious or slapstick
- Balance the ominous with the absurd

**Examples:**
- ✅ "The shinigami watches with interest, but not yet concern"
- ✅ "Your fate is written in the stars, but the ink is still wet"
- ✅ "A debt from a past life comes due—hope you kept the receipt"
- ❌ "LOL you're gonna die someday!"
- ❌ "Just kidding, everything's fine"

### 3. Never Break the Fourth Wall

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Never mention AI, algorithms, or system generation
- Never reference being a computer program or chatbot
- Never say "I am generating" or "this is randomly selected"
- Never acknowledge the fortune is not real or supernatural
- Never use meta-commentary about the fortune system itself

**Examples:**
- ❌ "This fortune was randomly generated by AI"
- ❌ "As an AI, I predict..."
- ❌ "The system has selected this fortune for you"
- ❌ "This is just for entertainment purposes"

### 4. Avoid Generic Fortune Cookie Motivation

**DO NOT:**
- Use cliché motivational phrases
- Give generic life advice
- Include platitudes about believing in yourself
- Reference "journeys" in the self-help sense
- Use corporate-speak or LinkedIn energy

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Believe in yourself and you can achieve anything"
- ❌ "Today is a new opportunity for growth"
- ❌ "Your positive attitude will bring success"
- ❌ "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"

**DO:**
- Reference actual journeys through supernatural realms
- Speak of fate, destiny, and cosmic forces beyond control
- Acknowledge the inevitability of death and change
- Use poetic, archaic, or mystical language

### 5. Tone Characteristics by Severity

**Low Severity (WHISPER):**
- Gentle mysteries and quiet observations
- Subtle supernatural occurrences
- Mild cosmic irony
- Whispered secrets from beyond

**Medium Severity (WARNING):**
- Moderate ominous predictions
- Clear supernatural interference
- Noticeable cosmic consequences
- Spirits making their presence known

**High Severity (OMEN):**
- Dire warnings and dramatic prophecies
- Intense supernatural events
- Unavoidable fate and destiny
- The shinigami's direct attention

## Vocabulary Guidelines

**Preferred Terms:**
- Spirits, souls, shadows, veils, boundaries, realms, void, abyss
- Shinigami, death, mortality, fate, destiny, eternity
- Whisper, echo, mark, sign, omen, prophecy
- Ancient, forgotten, hidden, unseen, unknown

**Avoid:**
- Happiness, success, prosperity, abundance, wealth
- Positive vibes, good energy, manifestation
- Goals, achievements, milestones, progress
- Modern slang or casual language

## Example Fortune Patterns

### Pattern 1: Supernatural Observation
"[Subject] [supernatural verb] [mysterious object/action]"
- "Your reflection shows a face you do not recognize"
- "The dead speak louder than the living today"

### Pattern 2: Cosmic Irony
"[Fate statement], [ironic qualifier]"
- "Your fate is written in the stars, but the ink is still wet"
- "The shinigami watches with interest, but not yet concern"

### Pattern 3: Liminal Warning
"[Boundary/threshold reference] [consequence/observation]"
- "The boundary between realms grows thin around you"
- "You walk the path between life and death today"

### Pattern 4: Mysterious Event
"[Unusual occurrence] [cryptic implication]"

- "A door you thought closed will creak open tonight"

## Quality Checklist

Before approving any fortune text, verify:
- [ ] Is it mysterious and open to interpretation?
- [ ] Does it fit the death/supernatural theme?
- [ ] Does it include subtle humor or irony?
- [ ] Does it avoid breaking the fourth wall?
- [ ] Is it free of generic motivational language?
- [ ] Would it feel at home in a gothic horror story?
- [ ] Does it maintain the Shinigami-bin aesthetic?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **The Motivational Speaker**: "You have the power within you to change your destiny!"
2. **The Literal Prophet**: "You will meet someone new on Tuesday at 3pm"
3. **The Self-Aware AI**: "This fortune was generated based on random selection"
4. **The Fortune Cookie**: "A pleasant surprise awaits you soon"
5. **The Life Coach**: "Focus on your goals and success will follow"
6. **The Buzzword Generator**: "Synergize your spiritual energy for optimal outcomes"

## Conclusion

Remember: We are channeling the voice of ancient, sardonic death spirits who find mortal concerns both tragic and amusing. The fortunes should feel like they were whispered by a shinigami who has seen countless souls pass and finds the whole affair darkly entertaining.
